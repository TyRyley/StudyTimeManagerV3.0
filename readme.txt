> FAQ (questions and answers in the event that you have a problem while the program is running)

	- Q: What do I do if the program started, and nothing is happening?
	  A: Close the program. Open your Task Manager and check if the program appears, if it doesn't appear, then open the program again, if it does appear, right-click on it, click end task and re-run the program.

	- Q: What happens if you enter a string value instead of a number when adding a module (e.g. classHours - five)
	  A: The module will not be added to the database, instead an error message will appear telling you that you have to enter a number for classHours

	  A: Hold down ALT key and press the Enter key to exit a windowed view of the program and you will then be allowed to type.

> Troubleshooting:

	- What do I do if the program crashes while it is running?
